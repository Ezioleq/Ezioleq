### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- Iâ€™m currently learning **Rust, Node.js** and **Python**
- I often write my private projects in **C** and **C++** (not for long ðŸ¥º)
- Pronouns: he/his

I also like all the server stuff and virtualization of wide range of systems, I'm really into gamedev and desktop application programming, I don't like bloat, but it's sometimes necessary. Trying to learn new technologies but they're changing so fast ðŸ˜©
